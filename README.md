# debugging101

In these exercises we will start to understand reading error messages in the terminal.

## Running each file

Each javascript file will be runnable by using the command "npm run exercise##"

REPLACE ## WITH THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF THE FILE YOU ARE WORKING ON
IE: If you are in thee file exercise01 the run command is "npm run exercise01"

For each html file, you can run them in your browser by right clicking the file and clicking "Run in default browser"

### Final Note
Not every file will have a single error, some might have multiple errors.
